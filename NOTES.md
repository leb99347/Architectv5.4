## 🔍 Project Overview

ArchitectV4 is a modular, intelligent trading system for GBPJPY designed around disciplined breakout/reversal logic, confidence-based decision-making, and a robust human-in-the-loop feedback loop.

## ✅ Current System Capabilities

### 🧩 Signal Strategy (v5.4)
- Multi-tap zone detection
- Strong candle + trend confluence
- ATR breakout scoring
- Session-aware filters (London/NY overlap)
- Modular indicator logic

### 🤖 Confidence Model (Track A)
- **4-feature model**:  
  \`trend_alignment\`, \`breakout_strength\`, \`multi_tap_score\`, \`atr_ratio\`
- Trained on real trade logs (\`logs/trade_log.jsonl\`)
- Uses balanced class weights
- Scored and validated via \`test_runner.py\`

## 🔀 A/B Model Routing (Coming Online)
| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| 🔄 A/B scoring with \`confidence_router.py\` | ✅ |
| 📊 Confidence logging and model comparison | 🔄 |
| 🧠 Full 10-feature model training (Track B) | ⏳ |
| 🧪 A/B model evaluator & drift detector | ⏳ |

## 🔁 Human-AI Feedback System

### Goals:
- Prevent **autonomous self-updating logic**
- Enable **intelligent recommendations only**
- Use trade logs and model outputs to suggest:
  - Feature tuning
  - Confidence threshold adjustments
  - Strategy modifications

### Flow:
1. **Shadow logging** of A/B model scores per trade
2. **Feedback monitor** detects performance trends
3. **UI dashboard** presents:
   - Visual analytics (backtest deltas, model win rates, signal tiering)
   - Trade example sets
   - Proposed updates (as JSON or markdown diff)
4. **You (Lemicha)** approve or reject strategy/model changes

## 🔐 Governance Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|----------|------|
| ❌ No auto-updates | All changes require human approval |
| ✅ Human in the loop | Final say is always yours |
| 📉 Reject regressions | Only improvements with evidence are considered |
| 🔎 Transparent logging | All decisions, scores, and changes are logged |

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps

1. ✅ Train & validate **10-feature model** via \`train_confidence_model_full.py\`
2. 🔄 Create **\`confidence_router.py\`** for runtime A/B scoring
3. 🧪 Build **\`ab_tester.py\`** to log A/B trade comparisons
4. 🧠 Launch **\`feedback_monitor.py\`** (early proposal engine)
5. 🖥️ Build lightweight **Flask/Streamlit UI** for strategy review + approval
