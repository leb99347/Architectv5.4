System Name: ArchitectV5.4 (Modular GBPJPY ML Trading System)

⸻

🔧 Overview

Finalized development strategy and priority checklist for rapid and clear implementation:
	•	Dual-model A/B testing (F4 vs F10)
	•	Shadow vs Live execution logging
	•	Centralized trade execution logic (trade_executor.py)
	•	Robust .pkl ML model compatibility fix
	•	Dynamic exit logic and trade management
	•	Seamless confidence learning feedback loop

All architectural and system logic decisions pre-established to minimize coding complexity.

✅ Confidence Model Fix & Compatibility

🎯 Problem
	•	.pkl model unreadable on M4 Macbook

🛠️ Action
	•	Re-train ML models locally (no placeholders/dummy data)
	•	Save two models explicitly:

joblib.dump(model_f4, "ml/models/trained_confidence_model_f4.pkl", compress=('xz', 3))
joblib.dump(model_f10, "ml/models/trained_confidence_model_f10.pkl", compress=('xz', 3))

📦 Files to Update
	•	ml/confidence_router.py: Load both models explicitly.
	•	signals/signal_generator.py: Dual-model outputs.
	•	ml/feature_utils.py: Ensure feature schema matches exactly.

🧪 Validation
	•	Test loading explicitly in a separate script:

import joblib
model = joblib.load("ml/models/trained_confidence_model_f4.pkl")
print("Loaded:", model)

🔁 Dual-Model A/B Toggle (F4 vs F10)

📡 Signal Output Format

{
  "confidence_f4": 0.74,
  "confidence_f10": 0.81,
  "selected_model": "f10"
}

📊 Logging
	•	Both confidence scores logged each trade
	•	Post-trade comparative analysis

⸻

🌓 Shadow vs Live Execution

🎯 Execution Modes
	•	live: Actual trades executed
	•	shadow: Trades logged but not executed
	•	backtest: Simulated full trades

📦 Log Fields
	•	mode: Execution mode
	•	model_used: “F4” or “F10”
	•	confidence_f4, confidence_f10
	•	result: Trade result (win/loss)

⸻

⚙️ Centralized Trade Execution

🔧 Refactor trade_executor.py
	•	Integrate entry, exit, logging into single unified function:

def execute_trade(signal, price_data, mode="live", model_used="F10"):

	•	Call centrally from:
	•	backtest_simulator.py
	•	Live trading script

⸻

📈 Dynamic Exit & Risk Logic

📂 exit_strategy.py Modules
	•	Trailing stop
	•	Liquidity detection
	•	Session-based exits
	•	Max drawdown protection
	•	Signal reversal detection

🛠️ Implementation Steps
	•	Modular logic, callable from trade_executor.py
	•	Update mock trades in backtesting to reflect real exit conditions

⸻

🔄 Confidence Learning Loop

🧩 Continuous Improvement Cycle
	•	Automatically label trades from logs (win/loss)
	•	Retrain confidence models periodically
	•	Feature importance monitored to prevent overfitting
	•	Enforce penalties for excessive drawdowns

⚠️ Safeguards
	•	Minimum trade threshold for retraining (e.g., >50 trades)
	•	Retraining interval: Biweekly or monthly

⸻

🛣️ Next Steps (Prioritized)
	1.	🔄 Retrain & fix ML models (.pkl)
	2.	🔁 Update confidence_router.py dual-model loading
	3.	⚙️ Refactor trade_executor.py for unified execution
	4.	🧪 Integrate dual-model scoring into generate_signal()
	5.	📦 Enhance logging for shadow/live trade comparisons
	6.	📊 Backtest thoroughly using new logging mechanisms
	7.	🔄 Establish automated retraining script (train_confidence_model.py)

⸻

🚩 Success Metrics & Validation
	•	Models load flawlessly on Mac M4 chip
	•	Backtests yield realistic win rates
	•	Clear insights from shadow/live A/B logs
	•	Continuous model improvement evidenced by increased win rates and stable profitability
